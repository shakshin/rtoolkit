The kit contains:
1. GMCheck - checks your GMail inbox for unread messages. 
    This code originally create by user Postrational from www.commandlinefu.com and modified by me to get complete bash script.

2. IPNotify - monitors dynamic set of hosts and notifies you when one of them comes online.

3. NetMon - More complex than IPnotify script. It monitors fixed list of routers. Logs all state chenges into file and notifies administrator with libnoify.
